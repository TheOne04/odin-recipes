        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tomato soup is a soup with tomatoes as the primary ingredient. It can be served hot or cold, and may be made in a variety of ways.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>tomatoes</li>
            <li>olive oil and butter</li>
            <li>carrots, onion, and garlic</li>
            <li>balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>vegetable broth</li>
            <li>coconut milk</li>
            <li>dried thyme</li>
            <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>basil leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, saut√© the veggies. Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, and add the olive oil. Add the onion, carrots, garlic, and a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in the vinegar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, add the remaining ingredients and simmer. Add the canned tomatoes, water, coconut milk or heavy cream, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the carrots are tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend part of the soup. Scoop 4 cups of the soup out of the pot and set aside. Transfer the remaining soup to a blender, and blend until smooth. If you like, you could use an immersion blender for this step, though I prefer the smoother texture I get when I use my upright blender. Return the pureed soup to the pot, along with the 4 cups of chunky soup. Stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, season to taste and serve. That's it!
