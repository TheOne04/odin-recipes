        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes. 
            </li>
